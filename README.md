# intro-ml-projects-

Small machine learning projects in Python (classification and regression) as preparation for an MSc in Artificial Intelligence.

## Projects

1. `wine_classification.ipynb`  
   - Dataset: built-in wine dataset from scikit-learn  
   - Task: classify wine samples into one of three cultivars based on their chemical properties  
   - Methods: train/test split, feature standardisation, Logistic Regression classifier, accuracy, confusion matrix and classification report

2. `california_housing_regression.ipynb`  
   - Dataset: built-in California housing dataset from scikit-learn  
   - Task: predict median house value from features such as median income, house age, average rooms, population and latitude/longitude  
   - Methods: train/test split, feature standardisation, Linear Regression model, evaluation with mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), R-squared, and a scatter plot of actual vs predicted values
